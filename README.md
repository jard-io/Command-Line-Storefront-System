# Command-Line-Storefront-System
BalikEskwela Price Look Up System. A simple shop system made in C.

This was the first program I ever made. I learned programming with C, and while it was a soul-crushing experience, I've learned so much more since then.
It's unusual to display your worst work on GitHub, but I decided to keep it here just so that I could look back on where I started, and to reflect on how much I've grown.
